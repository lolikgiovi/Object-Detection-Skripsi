Hi Everyone!<br><br>
This is a repository for my bachelor degree's final project (called Skripsi in Indonesia).
I am trying to detect *tuberculosis bacteria* from *sputum images* using Faster R-CNN algorithm.
I used TensorFlow 2 Object Detection API written in Python and developed fully using Google Colaboratory.
